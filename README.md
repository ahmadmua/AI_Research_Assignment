<h1>Abstract</h1>

The white wine quality dataset is a collection of data on the chemical properties and sensory ratings of nearly 4898 white wines. The dataset contains 11 different features, all pertaining to the contents of white wine, which is rated by experts on a scale from 0 to 10 based on its quality. Through regression analysis and testing using various machine learning models, an experiment is conducted on the target variable of alcohol to predict the content of white wine based on a set of given features, and the machine learning model that provides the best performance in predicting the alcohol content of white wine. The results of the analysis concluded that the CatBoost Regression model was the most effective in predicting the alcohol content of white wine, achieving the balance of the lowest MSE score of 0.2268 and highest R-squared (R2) score of 0.934, with the Extreme Gradient Boosting machine model not falling far too behind. The model’s performance was further evaluated through various visualizations, which revealed some outliers that the most influential features for predicting the alcohol content were found to be density, residual sugar, and free sulfur dioxide. The CatBoost Regression model’s results conclude that the features in the dataset are very effective at predicting the alcohol contents of the wine and high level of accuracy indicates that the model is highly reliable for making predictions on new and unseen data.
